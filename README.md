# OnePageJS
OnePageJS is an open-source JavaScript library designed to help you create
seamless, smooth-scrolling one-page applications. With this library, you
can easily add scroll-based navigation to your website, allowing users
to navigate between sections with smooth transitions. It is lightweight,
easy to integrate, and works with a variety of front-end frameworks.

## State
OnePageJS is still in the early stages of development. While it provides
essential features for creating smooth scrolling experiences, expect
ongoing improvements and new features in future releases.

## Dependencies
OnepageJS is shipped as a single JavaScript file, so there are no external
dependencies required for basic usage.

However, if you're contributing to the project, you will need to install
[Bun](https://bun.sh/). This because Bun is used for several development tasks, including running tests,
bundling the files, and launching the development server.

## Javascript Support
OnePageJS is written in pure JavaScript and is designed to work seamlessly
across most modern front-end frameworks. You should be able to integrate
it easily into your project, whether you're using vanilla JavaScript,
React, Vue, Angular, or other common front-end frameworks.

However, if you're using a framework with a specific build system or
configuration, ensure that the library is properly bundled and included
in your project. For most projects, you can include the library as a
script tag or directly import it on your main component.

## Features
- Smooth scrolling: Transition between sections with smooth scrolling.
- Easy setup: No dependencies required for basic usage.
- Customizable: Supports basic configuration for scroll speed, easing functions, and navigation controls.
- Responsive: Fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- Compatibility: Works with modern browsers and most front-end frameworks.

## Usage

          }
        });
